# Josh-s-Portfolio
Portfolio homework for UCF bootcamp

Completed by Joshua Diaz

# Project Description:

Created a HTML and CSS files to develop and style a working webpage that would act as a porfolio. I constructed a structured html file organized using semantic tags, then adding fine details using different elements, classes, and Id's. I then began working on the CSS using what I've learned so far to complete the styling aspect of my webpage. If given more time I feel I could have definitely made further improvements to my webpage. Overall, I feel I surprised myself with how much I retained from the course so far and I also believe I learned more about styling through the work and research I performed on my during this assignment.
